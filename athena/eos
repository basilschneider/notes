EOS is the disk storage system at CERN for large physics data. The following is
a quick tutorial for beginners. After the tutorial, you should know how to do
the following:

Upload a file to EOS Download a file from EOS to your local directory Check for
the presence of a file in your EOS home directory and the corresponding quota
This tutorial assumes that you are connected on LXPLUS. First of all, source the
following file (.sh or .csh depending on your shell).

% source /afs/cern.ch/project/eos/installation/<experiment>/etc/setup.sh

Since only selected user communities (typically your experiment) have got access
to EOS you might have a similar error (telling you that your Unix group has no
        EOS access)

% eos ls 
[eos.select] error: I don't have an instance mapped for group "zz"!

EOS home directories have a similar structure to your AFS directory. The
detailed structure of the EOS repository depends on the given experiment so
yours might differ a bit from the examples given here. EOS commands are often
very similar to Unix (for example ls --> eos ls).

First of all create a subdirectory on EOS:
% eos mkdir /eos/<experiment>/user/l/laman/eos_tutorial

Make sure you have a local file available for the test, where you will upload
your file to EOS:
% ls -l test.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 laman vy 2801 Apr 26 10:45 test.txt

Then copy the local file to your EOS directory:
% xrdcp test.txt
% root://eos<experiment>.cern.ch//eos/<experiment>/user/l/laman/eos_tutorial/eos.txt
 [100%][==================================================] [5/5]

You can check its presence on EOS with 'eos ls':
% eos ls -l /eos/<experiment>/user/l/laman/eos_tutorial
-rw-r--r--   1 laman    vy               2801 Apr 26 10:46 eos.txt

Now, copy it back in your directory (download) from EOS
% xrdcp
% root://eos<experiment>.cern.ch//eos/<experiment>/user/l/laman/eos_tutorial/eos.txt
% eos.txt
[100%][==================================================] [5/5]

% ls -l eos.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 laman vy 2801 Apr 26 10:54 eos.txt

Please note that: xroot is the data transfer protocol eos<experiment>.cern.ch is
the host of the EOS (xroot) server
/eos/<experiment>/user/l/laman/eos_tutorial/eos.txt is the EOS full path

EOS has a quota and you can check it with the command "eos quota". Please note
that you have a limit on size and on number of files.


Remember that 'eos<experiment>' is the entry point  for your experiment (if
        enabled) so you should consult your computer group person.  As of today
the LHC experiments ALICE, ALICE, CMS and LHCb have dedicated instances. More
experiments are being added (eos<experiment>=eosalice, eosatlas, eoscms,
        eoslhcb, eosams and eoscompass) 

Important: at variance with CASTOR all EOS files are disk-only (no backup). In
case of inadvertent deletion by users or a major hardware failure EOS files
cannot be recovered.
