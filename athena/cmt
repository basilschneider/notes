To use cmt to checkout packages, you can do
$ cmt co <directory-tree>
which simply checks out the trunk. If you want a specific tag, you can use
$ cmt co -r <package_name-tag> <directory-tree>

<directory-tree> can be something like
InnerDetector/InDetValidation/InDetPhysValMonitoring

checking out with cmt does add a few informational files and then check out the
packages with svn. If you check out the packages with svn, the informational
files are missing and your code might not compile/run.
