 0) For general information, see
    https://www.drupal.org/docs/7/install
 1) For website development with e.g. drupal, you will need a stack, like LAMP
    (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP), install the packages drupal, apache,
    php-apache, mariadb; mariadb is community-developed fork of MySQL
 2) Try starting Apache
    sudo systemctl start httpd
 3) If you get any errors, follow this guide:
    https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Drupal
 4) Finally, you should be able to access drupal:
    http://localhost/drupal
 5) You will need MariaDB, check if it is already running
    ps -ef | grep mysqld
    Kill it and follow
    https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/MariaDB
 6) Once you have the MariaDB service running and configured, you need to create
    a database for drupal, follow:
    https://www.drupal.org/docs/7/install/step-2-create-the-database#mysql_commands
    The username is simply "root".
 7) You can now install drupal. The root directory will be
    /var/lib/drupal/
 8) If you get the error message "The website encountered an unexpected error.
    Please try again later.", add the following line to
    /sites/default/settings.php:
    $config['system.logging']['error_level'] = 'verbose';
