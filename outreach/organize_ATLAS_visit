Organize an underground visit:
- Make a request to the secretariat:
  - Check the calendar if date and time is still free
    https://publicoutreach.cern.ch/outreach/panel#agenda/today
  - Make a Private Visit Request
    https://publicoutreach.cern.ch/outreach/request-private-visit
  - The secretariat will handle the request
  - You can manage all your requests here (ANC02):
    https://myvisits.cern.ch/myvisits/secure/my-visits
- For every underground access, you will need an iMPACT (ANC03):
  - Go to https://impact.cern.ch/impact/secure/?place=searchActivity
  - Search for iMPACT with number 123256 and clone it, note down the new iMPACT
    number
  - Change responsible person, date and time
  - For all visitors, fill in their name and date of birth
  - Once done, save and submit it. Make sure it really gets submitted, maybe you
    have to "fix" some errors first.
  - The iMPACT need to be printed twice (why?), signed (once) by every visitor
    and be handed to SLIMOS
  - There are laminated versions of the part of the iMPACT that the visitors
    will need to sign, they are in the cupboard next to the LEGO model
- Dates and times:
  - Visits are possible from 6 May 2019 till August 2020. Every workday from 9

  - at least 16 years old

  - Last Name
  - Date of Birth
  - Place of Birth
  - Country of Birth
  - Nationality
- Backpacks cannot be taken down to the cavern, except when they have a volume
