Organize an underground visit:
- Make a request to the secretariat:
  - Check the calendar if date and time is still free
    https://publicoutreach.cern.ch/outreach/panel#agenda/today
  - Make a Private Visit Request
    https://publicoutreach.cern.ch/outreach/request-private-visit
  - The secretariat will handle the request
- For every underground access, you will need an iMPACT:
  - Go to https://impact.cern.ch/impact/secure/?place=searchActivity
  - Search for iMPACT with number 123256 and clone it, note down the new iMPACT
    number
  - Change responsible person, date and time
  - You will need names and birth dates from all visitors
  - The iMPACT need to be printed twice (why?), signed (once) by every visitor
    and be handed to SLIMOS
  - There are laminated versions of the part of the iMPACT that the visitors
    will need to sign, they are in the cupboard next to the LEGO model
