Organize an underground visit:
- For every underground access, you will need an iMPACT:
  - To fill the iMPACT, you can clone an existing one (Which one? What needs to
    be changed?)
  - You will need birth dates from all visitors
  - The iMPACT need to be printed twice (why?), signed (once) by every visitor
    and be handed to SLIMOS
  - There are laminated versions of the part of the iMPACT that the visitors
    will need to sign, they are in the cupboard next to the LEGO model
- Dates and times:
  - Visits are possible from 6 May 2019 till August 2020. Every workday from 9
    am till 6 pm
  - Visits always start at a full hour and last 1 hour. You can stay 15 minutes
    on the platform

- Visitors:
  - Groups need to have 4 to 6 people
  - Visitors need to be:
    - at least 16 years old
    - not pregnant
    - not having reduced mobility
    - not having vertigo
    - not being claustrophobic
    (- pacemakers seem to be fine, but check again if the case comes up)
  - Backpacks cannot be taken down to the cavern, except when they have a volume
    of 10 l or less; they can be deposited upstairs, but no liability is taken
