Virtualenv can be used to set up a package in a specific version only for one
software. It will create a subdirectory. So when you are in the folder of the
software you want to run, try

$ virtualenv venv

This will use the python interpreter that was used to install virtualenv, in my
case this is python3.5. To use a different python interpreter, do

$ virtualenv -p /uscms_data/d1/bschneid/pkg/bin/python2.7 venv

or wherever your favorite python interpreter is.

This creates a folder called venv.

To activate the virtual environment, do

$ . venv/bin/activate

This will change the shell. Now you can do

$ pip install package

to install the package only for this environment.

To leave the virtual environment, type

$ deactivate
