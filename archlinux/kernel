To change kernel, install it first (e.g. linux-lts). This should run
$ mkinitcpio -p linux-lts
automatically, otherwise run it by hand. If firmware is missing, try to find it
on AUR.
Then run
$ sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
Grub should find the new kernel automatically and create an entry in your
grub.cfg
Check the grub.cfg, what entry you would like to boot, then modify
/etc/default/grub and run
$ sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
again. You can also set the timeout and reboot, to dynamically choose what
kernel to boot. Just don't forget to always run
$ sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
after making changes to grub. To check what kernel you booted, try
$ uname -r

NB: Picking the kernel in GRUB does not seem to work.
