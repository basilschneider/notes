Working With Processes
======================

Use the following shortcuts to manage running processes.

Ctrl+C: Interrupt (kill) the current foreground process running in in the
terminal. This sends the SIGINT signal to the process, which is technically just
a request—most processes will honor it, but some may ignore it.

Ctrl+Z: Suspend the current foreground process running in bash. This sends the
SIGTSTP signal to the process. To return the process to the foreground later,
use the fg process_name command.

Ctrl+D: Close the bash shell. This sends an EOF (End-of-file) marker to bash,
and bash exits when it receives this marker. This is similar to running the exit
command.  ￼

Controlling the Screen
======================

The following shortcuts allow you to control what appears on the screen.

Ctrl+L: Clear the screen. This is similar to running the “clear” command.

Ctrl+S: Stop all output to the screen. This is particularly useful when running
commands with a lot of long, verbose output, but you don’t want to stop the
command itself with Ctrl+C.

Ctrl+Q: Resume output to the screen after stopping it with Ctrl+S.
