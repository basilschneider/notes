Regular expressions

In a regular expression a . represents one character, i.e.
reg.xp  can    be regexp, regaxp, ...
reg.p   cannot be regexp

A * can be used to have an arbitrary number of the character just used before, i.e.
regex*p can    be regexp, regexxxp, ...
r.*p    can    be rp, regexp, rasfdasdfp, ...
r*p     can    be p, rp, rrrp,
r+p     can    be rp, rrrp,

Quantifier    Description
*             matches 0 or more of the preceding characters, ranges or metacharacters .* matches everything including empty line
\+            matches 1 or more of the preceding characters...
\=            matches 0 or 1 more of the preceding characters...
\{n,m}        matches from n to m of the preceding characters...
\{n}          matches exactly n times of the preceding characters...
\{,m}         matches at most m (from 0 to m) of the preceding characters...
\{n,}         matches at least n of of the preceding characters...
[]            matches any *one* character that is inside the brackets, metacharacters become normal characters inside [], except - (indicates a range) when not
              in first and not in last position and ^ (indicates a reverse match) when in first position (in awk also \ keeps the meaning of an escape character

".*" is greedy
"[^"]*" is lazy (match " and then anything 0 or more times except " and finally another ")
