acpi
Shows information from the /proc filesystem, such as battery status or thermal information.

hash
bash remembers path's, for example if you have an executable in /bin and you move it later on to /usr/bin, bash will tell you that it can't find the executable in /bin. Use "hash -r" to clean the hash database and it should work.
