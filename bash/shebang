Shebang can only start at the very first character, it looks like

#!/usr/bin/env bash

where "bash" can be replaced by any interpretor (e.g. python). The script can then be invoked just by

./script

as opposed to 

bash script

or 

python script

Shebang can also look like

#!/bin/bash

but bash is not necessarily always in /bin.

Shebang can have one argument at most, in the example above it is the interpretor itself, 

#!/usr/bin/env bash -xv

does not work, but 

#!/bin/bash -xv

would. Instead use

#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -xv
