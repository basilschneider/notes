Although Bash is not a typed language, it does have a few different types of variables. These types define the kind of content
they are allowed to have. Type information is stored internally by Bash.

• Array: declare -a variable: The variable is an array of strings.
• Associative array: declare -A variable: The variable is an associative array of strings (bash 4.0 or higher).
• Integer: declare -i variable: The variable holds an integer. Assigning values to this variable automatically triggers Arithmetic Evaluation.
• Read Only: declare -r variable: The variable can no longer be modified or unset.
• Export: declare -x variable: The variable is marked for export which means it will be inherited by any child process.
