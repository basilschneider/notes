To compile (example from tmux installation):
./configure --help
./configure --prefix=$HOME/pkg
make
make install

or

./configure
make
make DESTDIR=$HOME/pkg install

If a dependency is installed in a home folder, make
./configure --help
to find out how to tell the configure where the package is, for example
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$HOME/pkg/lib/pkgconfig ./configure --prefix=$HOME/pkg

If a library is not found, do
file ~/pkg/bin/tmux
ldd ~/pkg/bin/tmux
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/pkg/lib

The folder structure in ~/pkg is like /

If an older version of e.g. tmux is installed, you might want to run
hash -r tmux
to delete the binding. Find the binding with
type tmux
