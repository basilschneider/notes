- Read shift leader white board. Read daily plan.
- Get update from last shift leader. You can check who was last and who will be
  next shift leader on ATLAS website under shifts. Talk about run plan, ATLAS
  conditions, errors and plans.
- Login on FSM (key symbol); might need to login twice, once on FSM and once
  on AlarmScreen? As shift leader you can basically login everywhere.
- Read checklist. It will be updated at the run meeting. Previous shift leader
  will tell you from deviations of the plan.
- Open text editor for elog. Open kWrite under General and open last elog, if
  not already opened. Save it as new log file, update and delete the contents
  of the last shifter. First entry in Shift chronology should mention the
  ongoing run and all its settings (taken from TDAQ panel (?)).
- All decisions that you take should enter the log.
- In Monitoring Partition panel, get information from the run. Monitoring
  Partition panel can be started in DAQ Panel. In Monitoring Panel, open
  DFPanel (Data Flow) and Trigger Panel (under load panels).
- Talk to people! Collect and spread information in the control room. Always ask
  how things are going. People should report back to you but they sometimes
  don't.
- Monitor AlarmScreen. Check alarms, right click on them to get information.
  E.g. see the trend of some values and investigate why they are there. Ask
  people in the control room, if it's not detector and not computing related,
  ask SLIMOS.
- In Trigger panel, check if e.g. SMK is set properly. Get this information form
  trigger white board.
- Busy presenter can also be started in DAQ Panel. Green is good, otherwise
  you have to investigate. Open Log Monitor, type in Run and Subsystem under
  Message to filter messages.
- If things change (e.g. you are running late), update plan of the day. Also
  update if things are done or ongoing. Inform all people (they might be in the
  control room, otherwise call them).
- Check whiteboards to get more information.
- Monitor ELisA from time to time. Experts might post solutions on it without
  telling you.
- When trigger drops and busy panel shows red, it might recover from itself.
  Consult Log to understand what happen. System might recover itself. If it
  happens often, you might want to restart run (last resort).
- In Trigger Presenter, you might open Panels and Plot certain Triggers.
  Monitor them and check for errors.
- OHP Tool: You can see histograms from the run. Gives you a way to
  investigate problems and collect information.
- In DQM Panel, you can monitor the different subdetectors.
- Monitor FSM. Normally, every error should trigger reaction. Also watch
  masked alarms from time to time.
- Always keep an eye on trigger rates, log messages, FSM, ELisA and Busy Panel
- If you have a serious problem, act immediately (call expert). If you see a
  strange feature, search in ELisA for information, read shifter assistant
  tool, ask around in ACR, call expert.
- If people want to do tests that are not in the daily plan, they should ask the
  run coordinators. The job of the shift leader is to stick to the daily plan.
- At the end copy/paste shift report to ELisA
