 1) Connect the GLIB with the test board and mount the MaPSA-Light onto the
    test board. The GLIB card used here is version 3, it is written on the back
    of the GLIB.
 2) Power up the GLIB with 12 V. Easiest is to use an old PC power supply.
    Remember to short-circuit the green cable to the ground, otherwise the power
    supply doesn't start. This is explained in detail in the GLIB manual on the
    GLIB public homepage. The test board needs a voltage between 3.5 V and 5 V.
    I use 3.8 V. Make sure that you have the +/- correct, it's written on the
    back of the power plug on the card. Connect a resistor between the + and -
    cable from the power supply for the test board.
 3) Flash the FPGA on the GLIB. Use iMPACT from Xilinx. I used a Windows machine
    but should be working on Linux too.
 4) Fire up the VM. I use VMPlayer, but Virtualbox should do fine. Before
    starting VMPlayer, you might need to start some services with
    $ sudo /etc/init.d/vmware start
    At some point I had the package "vmware-modules-dkms" installed which
    rendered the VMPlayer not working for me. I haven't investigated into that
    issue but removing the package solved it for me. To log onto the VM, use
    xtaldaq//xtaldaq
 5) Ping GLIB. The IP address of the GLIB is hardcoded to 192.168.0.175. Set
    your IP address on the host system to e.g. 192.168.0.100 and try to ping the
    GLIB:
    $ sudo ifconfig enp0s25 192.168.0.100 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
    $ ping 192.168.0.175
    On my system, if I cut the power from the GLIB, I lose the IP address, i.e.
    I have to assign it again after that. Try to ping GLIB from the guest system
    as well, this should work out of the box if the host is configured properly.
 6) Make sure to have the latest software, it can be found here
    https://github.com/knash/MAPSA_Software
 7) Run the software, first make sure ROOT is available
    $ . /opt/root/bin/thisroot.sh
    Then run
    $ python power.py -s on
    and
    $ python -i calibration.py
    This should produce some plots
