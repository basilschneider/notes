Events are embedded in <event> </event> tags. The first line contains
information about the event and the second line contains information about each
particle.

The event information:
- Number of particles (NUP)
- ? (IDPRUP)
- event weight (XWGTUP)
- scale (SCALUP)
- alpha_em used (AQEDUP)
- alpha_s used (AQCDUP)

The particle information:
- PDG number of particle (IDUP(I))
- status of particle (ISTUP(I))
- 1st mother of particle, event indexing is used* (MOTHUP(1, I))
- 2nd mother of particle, event indexing is used*, for a decay, this is 0 (MOTHUP(2, I))
- color of 1st particle (ICOLUP(1, I))
- color of 2nd particle (ICOLUP(2, I))
- energy of particle (PUP(1, I))
- momentum of particle in x-direction (PUP(2, I))
- momentum of particle in y-direction (PUP(3, I))
- momentum of particle in z-direction (PUP(4, I))
- mass of particle (PUP(5, I))
- proper lifetime of particle (VTIMUP(I))
- spin of particle (SPINUP(I))

* event indexing means that n refers to the nth line (particle) in the same
event, no PDG numbers are used!
