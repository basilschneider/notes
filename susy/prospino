When calculating the cross sections, the output to the console means the
following:

ii = -1    born consistent with non-degenerate squarks
ii = 0,1   born consistent[0] , nlo-type[1]
ii = 2     virtual correction
ii = 3     real gluon emission
ii = 4     subtraction term, crossed channels...
ii = 20    complete nlo (only sum of 1...9)
ii = 21    summed born term for non-degenerate squarks
ii = 22    summed born term multipled with squark-degenerate K factor
