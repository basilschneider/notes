Installation:
- Install LHAPDF and Resummino with the same gcc version. gcc 6.3.0 worked for
  me.
- Maybe LHAPDF and/or Resummino is on /cvmfs? I haven't checked.

PDF sets:
- For the pdf sets, LHAPDF is needed.
- The pdf sets are taken from cvmfs:
  /cvmfs/cms.cern.ch/slc6_amd64_gcc630/external/lhapdf/6.2.1-cms/share/LHAPDF/
- Recommendation is to use NNPDF31_lo_as_0118_1000 and NNPDF31_nlo_as_0118_1000,
  but as of now, this has not been confirmed by a higher authority. It would
  make sense to ask the CMS PDF WG (Katerina Lipka et al.)
- pdf_lo and pdf_nlo are the pdf sets, pdfset_lo and pdfset_nlo are the subsets,
  0 is usually the central value (best fit).

PDF4LHC recommendations:
- There are 3 global fitting PDF working groups (i.e. they use data from
  different experiments): CTEQ, MSTW and NNPDF.
- In 2010, the recommendation at NLO was to use an envelope of CTEQ6.6, MSTW2008
  and NNPDF2.0. At NNLO only MSTW2008 was available, therefore it was suggested
  to use MSTW2008, but the uncertainties from NLO.
- In 2013, it was suggested to use the updated PDF sets of CT10, MSTW2008, and
  NNPDF2.3. They all agreed to fix the strong coupling alpha_s(m_Z^2) at 0.118
  +/- 0.0012, which was taken from PDG.
- For Run-2 (2015), the envelope procedure is no longer necessary, a purely
  statistical combination is sufficient.
- It is recommended to use CT14, MMHT2014 and NNPDF3.0, all are available at NLO
  and NNLO at alpha_s = 0.118. These are combined in the PDF4LHC15 sets.

  Which set to use? The MC one, as suggested for high TeV searches?
