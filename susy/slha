SUSY Les Houches Accord

Block EXTPAR:

Optional input parameters for non-minimal/non-universal models. This block may
be entirely absent from the input file, in which case a minimal type of the
selected SUSY breaking model will be used. When block EXTPAR is present, the
starting point is still a minimal model with parameters as given in MINPAR but
with each value present in EXTPAR replacing the minimal model value of that
parameter, as applicable. If MINPAR is not present, then all model parameters
must be specified explicitly using EXTPAR. All scale-dependent parameters are
understood to be given in the DR scheme.

0: M_input. Input scale for SUGRA, AMSB, and general MSSM models. If absent, the
GUT scale derived from gauge unification will be used as input scale. Note that
this parameter has no effect in GMSB scenarios where the input scale by
definition is identical to the messenger scale, Mmess. A special case is when Q
= MEWSB ≡ √mt˜1mt˜2 is desired as input scale, since this scale is not known
beforehand. This choice can be invoked by giving the special value Minput = −1.

Gaugino Masses:
1: M1(M_input), U(1)_Y gaugino (Bino) mass.
2: M2(M_input), SU(2)_L gaugino (Wino) mass.
3: M3(M_input), SU(3)_C gaugino (gluino) mass.

Trilinear coupling:
11: A_t(M_input), Top trilinear coupling.
12: A_b(M_input), Bottom trilinear coupling.
13: A_tau(M_input), Tau trilinear coupling.

Higgs Parameters, only one of the parameter sets (21, 22), (23, 24), (23, 26),
(23, 27) should be given, they merely represent different ways of specifying the
same parameters:
21: m^2_H1(M_input), Down type Higgs mass squared.
22: m^2_H2(M_input), Up tyep Higgs mass squared.
23: mu(M_input), mu parameter.
24: m^2_A(M_input), Tree level pseudoscalar Higgs mass parameter squared
25: tan beta(M_input), If present, this value overrides the one in MINPAR and
the input scale is taken as M_input rather than M_Z
26: m_A^0, Pseudoscalar Higgs pole mass.
27: m_H^+, Charged Higgs pole mass.

Sfermion Masses:
31: m_e_L(M_input): Left 1st generation scalar lepton mass.
32: m_mu_L(M_input): Left 2nd generation scalar lepton mass.
33: m_tau_L(M_input): Left 3rd generation scalar lepton mass.
34: m_e_R(M_input): Right scalar electron mass.
35: m_mu_R(M_input): Right scalar muon mass.
36: m_tau_R(M_input): Right scalar tau mass.
41: m_q_1L(M_input): Left 1st generation scalar quark mass.
42: m_q_2L(M_input): Left 2nd generation scalar quark mass.
43: m_q_3L(M_input): Left 3rd generation scalar quark mass.
44: m_u_R(M_input): Right scalar up mass.
45: m_c_R(M_input): Right scalar charm mass.
46: m_t_R(M_input): Right scalar top mass.
47: m_d_R(M_input): Right scalar down mass.
48: m_s_R(M_input): Right scalar strange mass.
49: m_b_R(M_input): Right scalar bottom mass.

Cross-section:

The block starts with

XSECTION SQRTS PDG_CODE1 PDG_CODE2 NF PDG_CODE3 ..., where

- SQRTS: a floating number representing the center-of-mass energy, to be given
  in GeV.
- PDG_CODE1 and PDG_CODE2: two integer numbers, representing the pdg codes
  of the initial state particles
- NF: an integer number, representing the number of final state particles
- PDG_CODE3, PDG_CODE4, ...: the pdg codes of the final state particles

This general information line is then followed by the cross section themselves,
given as a series of line under the form

SCALE_SCHEME QCD_ORDER EW_ORDER KAPPA_F KAPPA_R  PDF_ID VALUE CODE VERSION,
where

- SCALE_SCHEME: an integer number, related to the way the central scales are
  chosen. So far, the choices are
  - 0: the central scale is the average mass of the produced particles
  - 1: fixed scales
  - 2: the scale is set to the partonic center-of-mass energy
  - 3: the scale is set to the transverse mass of the final state particles
- QCD_ORDER: an integer number, which contains information on the order in
  alpha_s included in the computation. This is codified as
  - 0: Born cross section
  - 1: NLO cross section
  - 2: NLO+NLL cross section
- EW_ORDER: same as above but with respect to electroweak corrections
- KAPPA_F: a floating point number, related to the variation of the
  factorization scale with respect to the central scale. For SCALE_SCHEME set to
  1, the scale itself has to be provided.
- KAPPA_R: same as above, for the renormalization scale
- PDF_ID: the lhapdf code of the employed parton densities
- VALUE: a floating point number, representing the value of the cross section in
  pb.
- CODE: a string representing the name of the program which has computed the
  cross section
- VERSION: a string, the version number of the proram employed
