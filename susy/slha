SUSY Les Houches Accord

Cross-section:

The block starts with

XSECTION SQRTS PDG_CODE1 PDG_CODE2 NF PDG_CODE3 ..., where

- SQRTS: a floating number representing the center-of-mass energy, to be given
  in GeV.
- PDG_CODE1 and PDG_CODE2: two integer numbers, representing the pdg codes
  of the initial state particles
- NF: an integer number, representing the number of final state particles
- PDG_CODE3, PDG_CODE4, ...: the pdg codes of the final state particles

This general information line is then followed by the cross section themselves,
given as a series of line under the form

SCALE_SCHEME QCD_ORDER EW_ORDER KAPPA_F KAPPA_R  PDF_ID VALUE CODE VERSION,
where

- SCALE_SCHEME: an integer number, related to the way the central scales are
  chosen. So far, the choices are
  - 0: the central scale is the average mass of the produced particles
  - 1: fixed scales
  - 2: the scale is set to the partonic center-of-mass energy
  - 3: the scale is set to the transverse mass of the final state particles
- QCD_ORDER: an integer number, which contains information on the order in
  alpha_s included in the computation. This is codified as
  - 0: Born cross section
  - 1: NLO cross section
  - 2: NLO+NLL cross section
- EW_ORDER: same as above but with respect to electroweak corrections
- KAPPA_F: a floating point number, related to the variation of the
  factorization scale with respect to the central scale. For SCALE_SCHEME set to
  1, the scale itself has to be provided.
- KAPPA_R: same as above, for the renormalization scale
- PDF_ID: the lhapdf code of the employed parton densities
- VALUE: a floating point number, representing the value of the cross section in
  pb.
- CODE: a string representing the name of the program which has computed the
  cross section
- VERSION: a string, the version number of the proram employed
