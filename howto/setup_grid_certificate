To run on the grid, you must have a valid grid certificate. Hopefully, you will have this already! However, it may currently be still loaded in your browser and so you need to go through a few steps to export it to your userarea:

1) Set up the grid environment:
source /afs/cern.ch/project/gd/LCG-share/current/etc/profile.d/grid_env.sh

2) Create a .globus directory:
cd $HOME
mkdir ~/.globus
cd ~/.globus

3) First, export the grid certificate. This is browser dependent, but in Firefox do:
Edit -> Preferences -> Advanced -> View Certificates
Select you certificate and click on 'Backup'. You should then be requested to download your certificate. Download it to your .globus directory you created above as 'grid.p12'.

4) Now the certificate must be converted to the correct form by doing the following:
openssl pkcs12 -in grid.p12 -clcerts -nokeys -out usercert.pem
openssl pkcs12 -in grid.p12 -nocerts -out userkey.pem
chmod 400 userkey.pem
chmod 600 usercert.pem

5) Hopefully, everything should now be ready so to check it's all OK, do the following:
voms-proxy-init --voms atlas
which should give something like this:
Cannot find file or dir: /home/slater/.glite/vomses
Enter GRID pass phrase:
Your identity: /C=UK/O=eScience/OU=Birmingham/L=ParticlePhysics/CN=mark slater
Creating proxy ........................................................................................................ Done
Your proxy is valid until Sun Dec 14 03:34:50 2008
