 0) These instructions describe how to format an external USB drive with the
    NTFS file system. The generic command to mount a USB drive is
    $ sudo mount /dev/sdb1 "${dir}"
 1) Figure out what device file the disk corresponds to
    This can be done in a number of ways, e.g. using dmesg. I found an easy way
    to figure this out to simply do
    $ ll /dev/sd*
    and then do it again after having plugged in the USB drive. The new device
    file is the one we are looking for. It is referred to from here on as
    "${device}" ("${device}" does not have a number in the end, that would then
    be a partition). Using /dev/sd* assumes that you have a SCSI controlled
    disk, otherwise it would be /dev/hd*.
 2) Partition the disk
    Run
    $ sudo fdisk "${device}"
    Use "m" to see the menu. Delete all partitions with "d". Then print the
    partition table with "p". It should be empty. Create a new partition with n,
    and use all the default values. These values are chosen by fdisk and depend
    among other things on the type of disk you have (MBR or GPT). If fdisk asks
    you to remove e.g. a "ntfs signature", you can do so, since this is a
    Windows thing. Invoke
    $ ll /dev/sd*
    again, and note down the partition, which has a number in the end. It will
    be referred to "${partition}" from here on.
 3) Format the disk
    Run
    $ sudo mkfs.ntfs "${partition}"
    to format it with NTFS. NTFS is a useful file system for external hard
    drives, since it can be read by Linux, macOS and Windows. If ntfs-3g is
    installed on Linux, it will also be able to read to NTFS. There might exist
    better filesystems, though. This operation will take a while. For a disk
    with 4 TB = 3.7 TiB, it took a bit over 10 hours, last time I tried.
 4) Label the disk
    It is useful to give the disk a unique label, to simplify the mounting
    process later on. For NTFS, to check if the disk already has a label, run
    $ sudo ntfslabel "${partition}"
    The ntfslabel utility comes with the ntfs-3g package.
    To change the label, run
    $ sudo ntfslable "${partition}" "${label}"
 5) Mount disk
    You can now mount the disk with your utility by invoking
    $ mountUSBDrive "${label}"
    where "${label}" needs to be the same as defined in step 4).
