On Debian:
1) Download rpm package at
   http://ftp.riken.jp/Linux/cern/slc6X/updates/SRPMS/repoview/lpadmincern.html
   deprecated: http://linuxsoft.cern.ch/cern/slc41/i386/yum/updates/repodata/repoview/lpadmincern-0-1.2-2.slc4.html
2) Change the rpm package to a deb one by
   $ sudo alien *.rpm
3) Install the deb package
   $ sudo dpkg -i *.deb
4) Get the name of your favourite printer here
   https://printservice.web.cern.ch/printservice/UserTools/PrinterList.aspx
5) Try to run
   $ sudo /usr/sbin/lpadmincern --add $nameOfPrinter
6) If you get an error like
   Can't locate Net/LDAP.pm in @INC
   install Net/LDAP.pm with
   $ sudo cpan
   and then
   $ install Net::LDAP
   You might be asked if you want to configure as much as possible automatically. Say yes.
7) If you get an error like
   > Can't exec "/sbin/service": No such file or directory
   in /usr/sbin/lpadmincern change
   my $cupsc='/sbin/service cups reload';
   to
   my $cupsc='sudo service cups restart'; (RedHat specific)
   my $cupsc='/etc/init.d/cups restart';  (Debian specific)
   and try again
