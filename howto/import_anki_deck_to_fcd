How to import an Anki deck to Flashcards Deluxe
===============================================

 1) Clean up Anki first, to not import unnecessary files. Delete
    ~/.local/share/Anki*/ (assuming you don't need Anki)
 2) Import the deck in Anki. If you have an *.apkg file, you can use Anki 2.1.
    If you have a deck with files like shared.anki, then you need to open it in
    Anki 2.0, and telling Anki that it is an Anki 1.2 deck. Note how many cards
    you import.
 3) Export the deck in Anki. Select "Notes in Plain Text" or "Cards in Plain
    Text" and select "Include tags". Call the deck example.txt. Make sure you
    export the same number of cards as you have imported.
 4) Copy the media to the same place where example.txt is stored, and rename the
    folder to "example Media". For Anki 1.2 decks, you can copy the folder
    called shared.media. For *.apkg deck, you can find it under
    ~/.local/share/Anki2/User\ 1/collection.media (or similar)
 5) Copy the text files including the media to Dropbox and sync it.
 6) Import it in Flashcards Deluxe
