Samsung Galaxy S6
=================

# With jmtpfs, very slow lately
1) Connect via USB, unlock device, click "Allow"
2) cd ~/mnt; mkdir samsung; jmtpfs samsung
3) If this doesn't work, you can try
   sudo mtp-detect
4) sudo umount samsung

# With go-mtpfs, not working at all
1) Connect via USB
2) cd ~/mnt; mkdir samsung; go-mtpfs samsung &
3) If it exits immediately, unlock device and click "Allow"
3) sudo umount samsung

# Use AirDroid, very unreliable
1) Make sure that both phone and computer are connected to same network
2) Open AirDroid app on phone
3) Note IP address on app, go to address with browser on computer


# Since all options are very slow and tedious, the best way I found is to get a
# list of files that you want to move and then always reconnect after each file:
cd ~/mnt
while read line; do
    echo "${line}"
    jmtpfs samsung
    mv samsung/Phone/DCIM/Camera/"${line}" ~/Downloads/
    sudo umount samsung/
done < files.txt

Huawei Google Nexus 6P
======================
# Same procedure as for Samsung Galaxy S6 with AirDroid app, jmtpfs not working,
# but not really tested
