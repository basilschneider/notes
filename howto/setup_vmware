Get VMware player (not workstation or anything else)

https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/free#desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_player/5_0

sudo bash VMware-Player-4.0.2-591240.x86_64.bundle

install dependencies:
sudo aptitude install build-essential linux-headers-`uname -r`

Load your VMware virtual disk (download it somewhere)

It is not allowed to run Mac OS X Guest on vmware. However, we don't care about that, obviously. To run it you have to patch vmware.

Usually the patch is also in the torrents of the virtual disks

Check www.souldevteam.net for latest virtual disks.

Install vmware tools to change resolution or move files from host to guest per drag and drop. Probably vmware tools cannot be installed directly from the menu,
        so look at www.souldevteam.net for a downloadable file and install by hand.
        Check also here for the correct version of vmware tools: http://softwareupdate.vmware.com/cds/vmw-desktop/fusion/

If you get an error about VT-x issues, enable "Intel Virtualization Technology" in the BIOS (usually under config/CPU) (not sure if VT-d is needed too, check
https://communities.vmware.com/docs/DOC-8978)


Beware: there might be hardware incompatibilites, e.g. I did not manage to run Mac OS X 10.8 on Lenovo ThinkPad T400, but it worked on Lenovo ThinkPad T410.
