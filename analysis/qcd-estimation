From Artur:

1) Make plots of the Lp distributions for anti-selected electrons in LT bins for
   Nj = 3,4 and Nb = 0. the cut-file must be in susy-1lep/data/qcd**** the plot
   file is somewhere in susy-1lep/qcd-est/txtconfigs/Lp_LTbins...
2) Do the Lp template fits using the makeQCDfits macro in the qcd-est folder you
   can check the fullQCDfit.sh (or sth like that) file in the same folder for
   the required options
3) Use the fRatios from the text file in the following steps of the bin yields
   (appendRcsKappa)
