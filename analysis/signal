How to find what signal sample points are available:

1) Go to DAS website:
   https://cmsweb.cern.ch/das/
   and make a query, e.g.
   dataset=/SMS-T5qqqqWW_mGl-825to1000_mLSP*/*/MINIAODSIM

   Since some signal points are lumped together, this does not give you a good
   overview what samples are available.

2) Check the Twiki:
   https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/SUSYMCProduction13TeV

   This might be not up to date, though.

3) Go to McM by clicking a link on the Twiki, or by going to
   https://cms-pdmv.cern.ch/mcm/
   and search for the sample

4) In McM, click on "Select View" and enable the "Mcdb id" column, then write
   down the Mcdb id of the sample you are interested in. Now you can do
   xrdfs root://eoscms.cern.ch/ ls /eos/cms/store/lhe/${mcdbid} (cmslpc)
   or
   eos ls /store/lhe/${mcdbid} (lxplus)
   to get a list of all LHE files. You can read the LHE files themselves or
   deduce from the filenames what signal points are available.
