 1) Check slides withe exercises
    http://whitehat-training.cern.ch/course/01.injection/slides/#/
 2) Try to enter "value'", or something similar, if you get an error message,
    that's good (for you; bad for the others)
    Sometimes you can see the SQL query in the error message, so you can learn
    something about the structure of the database
 3) Try other payloads from exercises
 4) Look at sqlmap
    sqlmap -a -u "${url}"
    (sqlmap seems only to work in bash, not zsh)
