ELOG
====

The elog can be found under
https://cmstkph2-beamtest.web.cern.ch/cmstkph2-beamtest/elog/186-Lab+Operation/

If it is not running or not responding, it needs to be (re)started:

1) Login on a different machine
   $ ssh xtaldaq@gauzinge.cern.ch
   b1ackh0le
2) If you want to make changes to the elog, like adding a new user, change the
   config file under elog/elogd.cfg
   If you make changes, restart the daemon
3) See if the elog daemon is running
   $ ps auxfw | grep [e]logd
4) If it is running, kill it
   $ killall elogd
5) Start elog daemon
   $ elogd -c elog/elogd.cfg -p 8082 -D
   -p defines the port, -D stands for daemon


Start triggers
==============

Triggered can be externally or internally, to trigger externally:

1) $ ssh xtaldaq@cmsuptracker006
   This machine is physically connected to the TLU (Trigger Logic Unit)
2) Set up environment in tmux:
   $ . ./setup_eudaq.sh
   $ . ./setup_eudaq_ROOT6.sh
3) Run
   $ ./run_GLIB_test.sh


Config files
============

The different firmwares have different config files. Right now, the config file
for the Strasbourg firmware can be found under
settings/HWDescription_2CBC.xml
while the config file for the Imperial firmware can be found under
settings/ICDescription.xml


Take data with miniDAQ
========================

Data can be taken with the GLIBSupervisor (XDAQ) (for the Strasbourg firmware)
or with miniDAQ, which is part of the middleware. For taking data with miniDAQ:

1) Go to ~/Ph2_ACF
2) Update .runnumber.txt. This file holds the latest run number. It gets updated
   automatically by miniDAQ, so there is no need to update it manually if data
   was only taken with miniDAQ. If on the other hand XDAQ was used, this number
   needs to be adjusted.
3) Make sure triggers are running.
4) $ miniDAQ -f ${configfile} -e 1000
   -f is the config file, -e the number of events
5) Make an elog entry


Take data with XDAQ
=====================

Taking data with XDAQ circumvents the middleware and works only for particular
firmwares, right now this is the Strasbourg firmware.

1) Start the XDAQ server
2) Adjust runnumber and number of events
3) Click enable
4) Click auto refresh to see data acquisition
5) Make an elog entry


Configure FPGA
==============

There are two slots where firmware can be stored. When starting up the CBC, it
automatically takes the firmware from slot 1. To change the firmwares on the
slotes:

1) $ fpgaconfig -c ${configfile} -f ${firmware} -i ${slot}
   See Config files for what ${configfile} to use, the Strasbourg firmware can
   be found under
   firmware/2CBC_beamtest_DIO5_stub_fixed.mcs
   The Imperial firmware can be found under
   firmware/IC_glib_top_DIO5_2CBConFMC1.mcs
   Note that you always have to use the Strasbourg firmware to change the
   firmware, since the Imperial firmware does not support firmware flashing (?)
2) $ fpgaconfig -i ${slot}
   If the -i flag is used without -f, the firmware from this slot is loaded
