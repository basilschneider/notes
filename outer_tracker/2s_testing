Testing the Full Module
=======================

- Use sublime as editor, it will automatically open all documents
- Use grounding bracelet, especially when it's cold
- 1 GLIB can read out 1 hybrid; the other FMC connector is used for triggers;
  you need to take measurements, then switch to other hybrid, then take
  measurements again; to read out both hybrids, need 2 GLIB's and different FW,
  while the different FW might not be working (see Tomasz's/Nicolas' email)
- To power up, you need 4 different voltages:
  voltage - current limit - current at power up - current while running
       5V          100 mA                 12 mA                   14 mA
      -5V          100 mA                 12 mA                   14 mA
     3.3V          300 mA                259 mA                  260 mA
     1.2V          700 mA                453 mA                  568 mA
  typically, < 80 mA per CBC at 1.2V are used
  cables go into power distribution box according to labels
- The power distribution box has two output cables:
  - Rainbow cable is for 8CBC
  - Yellow/white cable is for 2CBC
- Make sure your GLIB is cooled
- You can run the Middleware:
  fpgaconfig -f firmware/8CBC_DIO5_glib_be.mcs
  (always use this firmware, even when you do not use external triggers)
  hybridtest -r -f settings/HWDescription_8CBC.xml
  (runs register tests: writes 1010 and then 0101 to each register and reads
  back the values, always the first test to be done)
  hybridtest --short
  (to check for shorts)
  integratedtester
  (developed by Sarah Storey, not tested on 8CBC's)
  calibrate
  (make sure to use the result of the calibration in the XML file)
  hybridtest
  (should give a normal distribution after calibration)


Testing the Mini Module
=======================

 1. Interconnect the setup (you have sensor only on the TOP side)
 2. >source setup.sh in the Ph2_ACF directory
 3. power the hybrid  with LV, check the current consumption at 1.2V around 60mA
    for an inactive CBC2 (later on can be more than 70mA while datataking but I
    have never seen more than 80mA per chip)
 4. check other LV currents (below 50mA for 5 and -5V, below 200mA for 3.3V)
 5. run the registers test for CBC2 (>hybridtest -r)
 6. Cover the sensor from the light, and bias it step by step (0 10 50 100 200
    300) set limit to 100uA if we are biasing the sensor in a forward direction
    we could immediately see "a big current" around 10uA at 10V in backward
    direction at 10V we should see less than 1uA (with well covered sensor) at
    300V the current 2uA (assembly and sensor type specific)
 7. calibrate the hybrid with sensor bias to 300V and covered (>calibrate -f
    settings/Calibration2CBC.xml) if necessary change number of events in the
    Calibration2CBC.xml (last section of the XML file <Setting
    name="Nevents">1000</Setting> ) check the calibration plots
 8. put the calibration results path in the hybrid testing XML
    (settings/HybridTest2CBC.xml) <CBC_Files
    path="Results/Calibration_Hole_07-07-16_16:31:37/"/>
 9. run hybridtest for the Vcth value used in calibration (default 0x78 = 120)
10. play with Vcth value (in hole mode lower Vcth => higher occupancy)
11. If you want to check sensor strips connectivity (go with Vcth high enough to
    see 0% occupancy with covered sensor, then uncover it remembering about
    current limit or/and lower bias HV and chceck if the hits are coming to all
    the channels) - not a healthy method
