From Tomasz:

here are the testing instructions for the mini-module:
0. Interconnect the setup (you have sensor only on the TOP side)
0. >source setup.sh in the Ph2_ACF directory
1. power the hybrid  with LV, check the current consumption at 1.2V around 60mA for an inactive CBC2 (later on can be more than 70mA while datataking but I have never seen more than 80mA per chip)
2. check other LV currents (below 50mA for 5 and -5V, below 200mA for 3.3V)
3. run the registers test for CBC2 (>hybridtest -r)
4. Cover the sensor from the light, and bias it step by step (0 10 50 100 200 300) set limit to 100uA
if we are biasing the sensor in a forward direction we could immediately see "a big current" around 10uA at 10V
in backward direction at 10V we should see less than 1uA (with well covered sensor) at 300V the current 2uA (assembly and sensor type specific)
5. calibrate the hybrid with sensor bias to 300V and covered (>calibrate -f settings/Calibration2CBC.xml)
 if necessary change number of events in the Calibration2CBC.xml (last section of the XML file <Setting name="Nevents">1000</Setting> )
check the calibration plots
6. put the calibration results path in the hybrid testing XML (settings/HybridTest2CBC.xml)
<CBC_Files path="Results/Calibration_Hole_07-07-16_16:31:37/"/>
7. run hybridtest for the Vcth value used in calibration (default 0x78 = 120)
8. play with Vcth value (in hole mode lower Vcth => higher occupancy)
9. If you want to check sensor strips connectivity (go with Vcth high enough to see 0% occupancy with covered sensor, then uncover
it remembering about current limit or/and lower bias HV and chceck if the hits are coming to all the channels) - not a healthy method
