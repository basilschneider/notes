Power up GLIB
=============

 1) Connect the GLIB with the test board and mount the MaPSA-Light onto the
    test board. The GLIB card used here is version 3, it is written on the back
    of the GLIB.
 2) Power up the GLIB with 12 V. Easiest is to use an old PC power supply.
    Remember to short-circuit the green cable to the ground, otherwise the power
    supply doesn't start. This is explained in detail in the GLIB manual on the
    GLIB public homepage. The test board needs a voltage between 3.5 V and 5 V.
    I use 3.8 V. Make sure that you have the +/- correct, it's written on the
    back of the power plug on the card. Connect a resistor between the + and -
    cable from the power supply for the test board. The current should read
    between 1.086 A and 1.114, though these are only empirical values.
 3) Flash the FPGA on the GLIB. Use iMPACT from Xilinx. I used a Windows machine
    but should be working on Linux too.
 4) Fire up the VM. I use VMPlayer, but Virtualbox should do fine. Before
    starting VMPlayer, you might need to start some services with
    $ sudo /etc/init.d/vmware start
    At some point I had the package "vmware-modules-dkms" installed which
    rendered the VMPlayer not working for me. I haven't investigated into that
    issue but removing the package solved it for me. To log onto the VM, use
    xtaldaq//xtaldaq
 5) Ping GLIB. The IP address of the GLIB is hardcoded to 192.168.0.175. Set
    your IP address on the host system to e.g. 192.168.0.100 and try to ping the
    GLIB:
    $ sudo ifconfig enp0s25 192.168.0.100 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
    $ ping 192.168.0.175
    On my system, if I cut the power from the GLIB, I lose the IP address, i.e.
    I have to assign it again after that. Try to ping GLIB from the guest system
    as well, this should work out of the box if the host is configured properly.
 6) Make sure to have the latest software, it can be found here
    https://github.com/knash/MAPSA_Software
 7) Run the software, first make sure ROOT is available
    $ . /opt/root/bin/thisroot.sh
    Then run
    $ python power.py -s on
    and
    $ python -i calibration.py
    This should produce some plots

Use Keithley electrometer
=========================

 1) The Keithley electrometer Model 6517A can be used to measure voltage,
    current, resistance, charge, temperature, and more. It acts also as a
    voltage source. There are two mode of operations for the voltage source. It
    can be used as standalone independent voltage source, or it can be hooked to
    the electrometer and the current can be measured. Since we want to monitor
    the current, we use the second mode, which is also referred to (at least in
    the official manual, not sure if anywhere else) as FVMI (force voltage/
    measure current). The manual can be found here:
    http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/pls/portallive/docs/1/7293199.PDF
 2) First we need to connect the INPUT on the backside with a triax cable
    (similar to a coax cable) and the V-SOURCE HI. The V-SOURCE LO is not used.
 3) Now we can power on the electrometer. Press "CONFIG" and then the up arrow
    to enter the voltage source menu. Then press right arrow till you see
    "METER-CONNECT" on the screen. Enter the menu by pressing "ENTER". Turn on
    this option. This internally connects the V-SOURCE LO and the Ampere meter
    LO, such that we can measure current.
 4) Now you can use the up and down arrows to define the voltage. Press "OPER"
    to supply the voltage. When I measured this with a multi meter, I got a
    voltage that was way too low (about half of what it should have been). This
    is because we still have "Zero Check" enabled.
 5) Now press "I" and then "Z-CHK". This should disable the "Zero Check" and the
    voltage that you have on the multimeter should be the same as the one you
    supply. Also the current should be measured on the electrometer. You can use
    the range up and the range down buttons to change the displayed accuracy.
    The purpose of "Zero Check" is to protect the instrument from overload and
    to zero the instrument. When "Zero Check" is enabled, the input of the
    electrometer is a large resistance. "Zero Check" should always be enabled
    when conditions change on the input circuit, such as changing functions
    (measurements) or connections.
 6) Steps 3) to 5) are stored in the config 0. So instead of doing these steps,
    you can press "MENU" and enter "SAVESETUP". Then you can restore
    configuration #0, press "OPER" and you should be at the same point as if
    you've carried out steps 3) to 5).

Apply HV
========

 1) To apply the HV it is important to get the polarity right. Try it with a
    very low voltage and measure the current. 1 V in the wrong polarity should
    give you a current in milli amps. In the right polarity, the HV will not
    draw more than 1 micro ampere, even when the operational HV (90 V) is
    applied.
