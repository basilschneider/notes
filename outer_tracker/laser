TO CONNECT TO THE LASER VIA SERIAL PORT
=======================================

Plug in the laser via USB, use
$ dmesg
to find out what file it's connected to. Usually it's something like
/dev/ttyUSB0. Then you need to make the connection via
$ setserial -g /dev/ttyUSB0
If you don't have the permission, add your user to the group dialout
$ usermod -a -G dialout bschneid
Then you can connect via
$ screen /dev/ttyUSB0 19200
where 19200 is the BAUD rate (from the manual)
