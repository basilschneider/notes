In order for labview to see the Zaber motors, ni-visa and its drivers need to be
installed. Several dependencies need to be met. This runs in 32 bit mode, only,
so you have to install the i686 packages.

Then run visaconf, to see your device. Unplug and replug, to understand which
one is your device. Give the device a proper name. You can also double click to
see what device binding it is using (e.g. /dev/ttyUSB0).
