" vim: set ft=vim
" Setting filetype to vim works only when modeline is enabled, which it
" typically isn't, due to vulnerabilities, e.g. I have
set nomodeline
" in my .vimrc. Here you can set ft to vim by hand, to show some fancy colors.

" Super simple function:
:function DisplayName(name)
:  echom "Hello! My name is:"
:  echom a:name
:endfunction

" Of course, if you put this into your .vimrc, you remove all the colons at the
" beginning.

" a: is used to tell vim the scope of the variable. To make a long story short,
" you always need to prefix arguments with a: when you use them to tell Vim that
" they're in the argument scope.

" To call the function, you do
:call DisplayName("MyName")
" (:call calls a function, :exe executes a command.)

" To possibly overwrite an existing function, you can use !
:function! DisplayName(name)

" Here's an example of a fancy function
function! SearchList(pattern)
    exe ":g/".a:pattern."/z#.1"
endfunction

" It simply packs the execution of some command into a function. You can also
" pack this into a command, e.g.:

:command! -nargs=1 SL g/<args>/z#.1
