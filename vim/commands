Some useful commands

Navigation
- "b" goes to previous word, "w" goes to the end of the word
- "cw" change word

Some general stuff
- ":qa:" or "<leader>q" to quit, ":qa!" to quit even when there are unsaved changes
- ":w" or "<leader>w" to write changes in buffer
- "jj" or "<ESC>" to exit insert mode and return to normal mode
- "u" to undo, "Ctrl+r" to redo
- "<leader><cr>" or ":@" to redo last command
- Use "v" (normal), "Shift+v" (lines), "Ctrl+v" (vertical) for highlighting
- ":noh" to remove highlighting
- "<leader>f" or ":MRU" opens the MRU browser
- ":scriptnames" to list all loaded plugins
- Fancy! "<leader>ch" to open cheatsheet

Copy/Paste:
- "d" cuts, "y" yanks (copies) and "p" pastes
- Use "<Ctrl>-p" and "<Ctrl>-n" to move back and forth in the yankring
- To copy text to the clipboard, use ""+y"
- To paste from the clipboard, use ""+p", "Ctrl+v" might work, too but usually some characters get lost, so don't use it. If the indenting looks strange after pasting, try ":set paste", deactivate this mode again with ":set nopaste"

Search:
- "/[regexp]" to search forward and "?[regexp]" to search backwards for a regular expression
- ":s/x/y/gc" to replace every x with a y. g stands for global, otherwise it looks only for the first appearance in every line; c stands for confirm. The forwardslash can be replaced by any other symbol
- ":s/^x/y/g" searches only for x as a first character per line.
- ":%s/x/y/g" to replace every x with a y in the entire document, ":1,10 s/x/y/g to replace every x with a y in the lines 1 to 10 in the document.
- ":s/\(abc\)def/\1/g" replaces abcdef with abc (this gets powerful when using .*!)
- "*" to search the word under the cursor
- To grep, use "<leader>gr"
- To vimgrep, use "<leader>vg"

When working with tabs
- "3gt" or "tabn3" switches to the 3rd tab

When working with buffers
- ":Bclose" or "<leader>bd" closes a buffer
- ":b n" to switch to buffer n, one can also use ":b <TAB>"
- "<leader>bu" to open ~/Downloads/vim-buffer

Programming
- "<leader>tl" or ":TlistToggle" to open taglist
- "<leader>al" or ":A" to alternate
- "Ctrl-]" to jump to the definition of a function, "Ctrl-t" to jump back
